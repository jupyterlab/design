# Home of JupyterLab UX research assets. 

Here you can find all the research documentation for JupyterLab and it's side projects.
It is a centralized place to reference studies and results, as well as guidelines and methodologies for those who wish to contribute and increase our knowledge and understanding of users.

# How you can contribute

## As a JupyterLab user

If you are a JupyterLab user and want to share information related to
- your workflows 
- your user experience pain points
- your persona


## As a UX Researcher or Designer

### By Sharing
If you have performed a research study and would like to share your test protocol and/or the final results

Share - A UX Researcher has either a test plan and/or a final report that needs to be peer reviewed. They ensure it's shareable and editable.

### By reviewing

Document what you know about JupyterLab users


The UX Research peer review process is designed to be asynchonous and inclusive to all UX Researchers. The process is as follows:

Post - Within the #ux_research_team_lounge Slack channel, they post a link to the test plan or final report, along with a request to review. They include a date and time that they need feedback by.
Example: "Hi - can I please request a review of this test plan (link)? Feedback is needed by Thursday. Thank you!"
Best practice: Reviewers should aim to provide reviewers at least 24 hours to review.
Review - The reviewer provides feedback directly in the document, issue, etc.
Inform - When the review is complete, the reviewer responds to the thread and mentions the UX Researcher.
Example: "@ name - your testplan has been reviewed. Let me know if you have any questions!"
Edit - The UX Researcher looks at the feedback, follows up on any questions, and makes any adjustments necessary.
Mark as done - When complete, they put a green check mark emoji reaction on their original post, indicating that the peer review request has been completed and is closed.
UX Researchers are all required to take part in a peer review with their participant screeners, test plans, and final reports that they've created. Additionally, it's strongly encouraged for UX Researchers to help their peers by reviewing anything submitted through the peer review process.

When reviewing suggestions from peers asynchronously, it's a best practice to provide a note or explanation when closing suggestions. This is done to explain any rationale behind any decisions made around the suggestion and to add closure to the suggestion.

Ultimately, it's up to the owner of the document to decide which suggestions they'd like to apply.

# Guidelines for UX Researchers 


Where possible, UX Researchers should try to attend community meetings related to the subjects they are working on. This will enable UX Researchers to  offer ways in which they can assist in the delivery of research, as well as enabling them to communicate about the status of their ongoing studies. 


How UX Researcher conduct peer reviews
UX Researchers will frequently drive research projects themselves in close collaboration with Product and/or Design. When this occurs, UX Researchers will take part in a peer review process on the following research artifacts:

Participant screeners
Test plans
Materials contained in the test plan can include:
Scripts
Surveys
Card sort activity
etc
Final reports/output of the research
There are many benefits to a peer review process:


# Guidelines for Sharing

How UX Researchers socialize research findings
When we drive our own research projects, it means we're also responsible for socializing those insights. The most effective way to do that is as follows:



Create a brief into on what was done. (Example: Hi team! I recently finished a tree test :deciduous_tree: on the left sidebar navigation focused in the Monitor, Infrastructure, Deployments, and Packages & Registries items with experienced GitLab users. I'm excited to share the key insights :star: :)
List 3-4 bullets with the key insights. These should not include any detail - just very short sentences on the high-level findings.
Links to the: Research report, Video readout, Data sheet, Research issue, Dovetail project
A 'Next steps' sections that includes bullets on what will be happening as a result of the research. These should be links to issues that are actionable insights.
The posting is shared out via Slack to at least the three following channels: #ux, #ux_research, and #product. It's advised to also share the posting in any relevant stage-group channels, too.
Below is an example of the formatting:


# The purpose of this repo

Visibility - UX Researchers will be more informed about the research being conducted outside of their direct area of coverage.
Learning - UX Researchers can learn from each other by reviewing the approaches being taken and the justification behind those approaches.
Quality - Research deliverables will be more standardized and of higher quality as a result of a peer review.
Onboarding - New UX Research hires will benefit by seeing standardized examples and learning about the quality bar to replicate.
Diversity - We value diverse views and perceptions on how the content is being interpreted.
Mentoring - UX Researchers will have more opportunities to mentor each other in their craft.
Consistency - Participant screeners, in particular, will have a more standardized approach to how we ask the same questions across the team.


Four noteworthy benefits to conducting Foundational research:

Researchers gain subject matter knowledge in that topic
Researchers have an opportunity to impact Product and influence strategy
Career growth opportunities
The business benefits by gaining more knowledge/data in an specific area
