# Home of JupyterLab UX research assets. 

Here you can find the research documentation for JupyterLab and it's side projects.
It is a centralized place to reference studies and results, guidelines and methodologies for those who wish to contribute and increase our knowledge and understanding of users.

## What you will find in this repo

- Workflows
- Study plans and final reports
- Methodologies

# Contribution Guidelines

## As a JupyterLab user

If you are a JupyterLab user and want to share information related to
- your workflows 
- your user experience pain points
- your persona


## As a UX Researcher or Designer

### By Sharing
- If you have performed a research study and would like to share your test protocol and/or the final results: a UX Researcher has either a test plan and/or a final report that needs to be peer reviewed. They ensure it's shareable and editable.

- Templates and useful documents 

- Tools and best practices

### By reviewing
The UX Research peer review process is designed to be asynchonous and inclusive to all UX Researchers. The process is as follows:
UX Researchers are all required to take part in a peer review with their participant screeners, test plans, and final reports that they've created. Additionally, it's strongly encouraged for UX Researchers to help their peers by reviewing anything submitted through the peer review process.

When reviewing suggestions from peers asynchronously, it's a best practice to provide a note or explanation when closing suggestions. This is done to explain any rationale behind any decisions made around the suggestion and to add closure to the suggestion.

Ultimately, it's up to the owner of the document to decide which suggestions they'd like to apply.

# Guidelines for UX Researchers 

Where possible, UX Researchers should try to attend community meetings related to the subjects they are working on. This will enable UX Researchers to  offer ways in which they can assist in the delivery of research, as well as enabling them to communicate about the status of their ongoing studies. 


How UX Researcher conduct peer reviews
UX Researchers will frequently drive research projects themselves in close collaboration with their team or the users from the community. When this occurs, UX Researchers will take part in a peer review process on the following research artifacts:

Participant screeners
Test plans
Materials contained in the test plan can include:
Scripts
Surveys
Card sort activity
etc
Final reports/output of the research


# Guidelines for Sharing

How UX Researchers socialize research findings.
When we drive our own research projects, it means we're also responsible for socializing those insights. The most effective way to do that is as follows:

Create a brief into on what was done. (Example: Hi team! I recently finished a tree test :deciduous_tree: on the left sidebar navigation focused in the Monitor, Infrastructure, Deployments, and Packages & Registries items with experienced GitLab users. I'm excited to share the key insights :star: :)
List 3-4 bullets with the key insights. These should not include any detail - just very short sentences on the high-level findings.
Links to the: Research report, Video readout, Data sheet, Research issue, Dovetail project
A 'Next steps' sections that includes bullets on what will be happening as a result of the research. These should be links to issues that are actionable insights.


# The purpose of this repo

Visibility - UX Researchers will be more informed about the research being conducted outside of their direct area of coverage.
Learning - UX Researchers can learn from each other by reviewing the approaches being taken and the justification behind those approaches.
Quality - Research deliverables will be more standardized and of higher quality as a result of a peer review.
Onboarding - New UX Research hires will benefit by seeing standardized examples and learning about the quality bar to replicate.
Diversity - We value diverse views and perceptions on how the content is being interpreted.
Mentoring - UX Researchers will have more opportunities to mentor each other in their craft.
Consistency - Participant screeners, in particular, will have a more standardized approach to how we ask the same questions across the team.

Four noteworthy benefits to conducting Foundational research:

Researchers gain subject matter knowledge in that topic
Researchers have an opportunity to impact Product and influence strategy
Career growth opportunities
The business benefits by gaining more knowledge/data in an specific area
