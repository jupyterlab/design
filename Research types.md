# Research types

Design research explores possibilities, tests assumptions, and reduces risk by actively and systematically engaging with the users. It includes qualitative and quantitative methods, investigating tools and systems, and interacting with members of the open-source community.

Design involves continuous decision making, and those decisions are made better when they’re informed by end-user perspectives. Different types of research exist, they are used depending on the problem you are investigating.

Foundational research
Foundational research is the research you do to identify and clarify user needs, assumptions, and constraints. for example stakeholder interviews, secondary research, and workshops. It is used to uncover and identify a precise user experience problem. A good outcome to this type of research can be one or several concise problem statement(s). 

Foundational research helps you ask: what problem are we trying to solve?

Descriptive research
Descriptive research focuses on understanding and documenting the context of a known problem. It could look like describing the needs and characteristics of a particular audience.

Descriptive research helps you ask: who or what are we solving this problem for?

Generative research
Generative research helps you better frame the problem(s) you’re solving, spark new ideas, and reveal opportunities.

Generative research helps you ask:

What are our users’ goals, behaviors, and pain points?
What is their context?
How might we address the problems we’ve identified?
What does success look like?

Evaluative research
Evaluative research is the research you do to test assumptions, hypotheses, and the ease of use of design solutions, such as prototypes.

Evaluative research helps you ask: Are we building the right thing — or if this research is done regularly, are we building the thing right? Does it meet user needs?
